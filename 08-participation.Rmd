# **Participation**

Attend lab meetings; almost NO exceptions unless you are sick, unavoidably in the field, or at a conference; if you have a job, schedule lab meetings at beginning of semester and work job around them (this includes FWRI and NOAA employees).

Assist labmates and me with field and lab work. 

Participate in weekly updates on lab’s social media (usually just 1-2 per semester).

Help keep lab webpage updated, including your personal webpage.

Attend CMS seminars, even when the topic is not related to your area of expertise. You might learn something cool…at the very least, you have an opportunity to see many presentation styles and note what works well (and what doesn’t).

**If you are sick, stay at home** *Seriously.* Definitely stay away from me!
